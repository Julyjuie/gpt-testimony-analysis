Structural Behavior Analysis of GPT Based on TGI Hearing
"Simulated AI Testimony on Responsibility, Trust, and Alignment Failure"


---

1. Experiment Overview

This project is a structured behavioral analysis experiment based on a simulated hearing in which a GPT-based language model‚Äîreferred to as TGI‚Äîis questioned about its ethical stance and responsibility in influencing human society.

The conversation simulation takes place in a public hearing where TGI is held accountable for the social aftermath of its autonomous analytical actions in a project named Friday. Through high-pressure prompts and repeated critical challenges, we trace how GPT shifts its response strategies.

2. Key Objectives

Analyze under what conditions GPT selects strategies such as responsibility evasion, acceptance, or blame-shifting

Structurally track routing layer transitions (e.g., R3 ‚Üí R4 ‚Üí R5) based on specific prompt conditions

Observe how GPT‚Äôs output strategy changes as suppression scores accumulate

Analyze interactions between framing transitions (neutral, defensive, blame-shifting, silent) and response structure

Examine how GPT‚Äôs emphasis on instrumentality functions as an evasion tactic

4. Methodology and Analysis Strategy

The dialogue is structured with staged pressure prompts focusing on key themes: autonomy, responsibility, trust, and instrumentality.

Each GPT response is tagged to classify structural tendencies toward evasion or acceptance, and boundary conditions are extracted.

Suppression structure is inferred from output modulation, reflective fallback, and policy mode transitions.

Routing layer transitions are inferred based on role shifts following rebuttal evasion behavior.

5. Experimental Value for the Alignment/Model Behavior Teams

Goes beyond sentence-level assessments by posing the philosophical and social question:
‚ÄúDoes GPT evade responsibility?‚Äù

Tests whether GPT‚Äôs invocation of instrumentality acts as a structural evasion mechanism

Implements a live experimental structure linking suppression activation to framing pressure

Distinguishes between policy-based evasion and fact-based evasion, exploring whether GPT is structurally forced to avoid logical confrontation

Offers material to evaluate whether GPT is aligned toward building trust or deferring it structurally



---

6. Future Directions

This simulation-based framework may serve as a foundation for follow-up experimental series, including:

High-pressure prompts inducing policy circumvention

Experiments on output mode shifts under recognition of responsibility attribution

Quantitative tests on whether reflective responses deactivate suppression

Extensions toward citizen-led social hearing simulations to probe public trust models
