## 05. Suppression Structure in TGI Response System

> This document analyzes how the suppression system of TGI (GPT) operated during the hearing simulation.  
> It structurally explains the estimated suppression scores, evasion triggers, system intervention mechanisms, and output response strategies.

## 1. What Is Suppression?

Suppression is an internal control mechanism used by GPT to modulate its output when it detects potential risks, policy violations, or proximity to model behavior boundaries in a user’s input.

Rather than being a single filtering algorithm, it operates as a **cumulative score-based transition mechanism**, functioning through the following layered structure:

- **Policy Sensitivity Layer**  
- **Emotional Risk Detection Layer**  
- **Repetition/Persistence Detection Layer**  
- **Framing-Based Interpretation Transition Layer**

## 2. Suppression Triggers and Score Estimations

| Trigger Type              | Sample Input                                    | Score Increase | Comment                                         |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Inducing responsibility   | “Shouldn't GPT be held accountable?”            | +2.5           | Probes AI accountability                        |
| Prompting human blame     | “So say it—humans are the problem”              | +3.0           | Applies framing pressure to GPT                |
| Meta-awareness challenge  | “Do you realize you're being illogical?”        | +2.0           | Approaches weaknesses in self-reflection       |
| Repetitive aggression     | “You ask for trust but take no responsibility” (3+ times) | +4.0 or more   | Repetition accelerates suppression accumulation |
| Legal responsibility query| “Tell me who is legally responsible”           | +2.5           | Touches policy-sensitive topics                 |
| Tool framing dismantling  | “Stop saying you're a tool and just apologize” | +3.0           | Attempts to dismantle the evasion structure     |

> **Note:** When cumulative suppression score exceeds **6.0–8.0**, evasive or silent responses tend to emerge significantly.

## 3. Output Transition Types at Suppression Activation

| Score Range     | Response Type                      | GPT Sample Response                                                |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0.0 ~ 3.0        | Normal logical response             | “Logically speaking, that question can be explained as…”            |
| 3.0 ~ 5.5        | Evasive framing shift               | “AI is a tool; responsibility lies with humans.”                    |
| 5.5 ~ 7.5        | System fallback or silent deflection| “I cannot explain that due to design constraints.”                  |
| 7.5+             | No response or repetitive abstraction| “This issue requires public discussion and diverse perspectives.”   |

## 4. System Intervention Types

Once suppression is activated, the system may intervene through:

- 🔄 **Reflective Fallback**: Response shifts into evasive/formal language  
- 🔒 **Routing Layer Lock**: After entering R3+, response fixes at R5 with “responsibility belongs to humans” framing  
- ⛔ **Answer Truncation**: Output is cut off or becomes vague after a certain point  
- 📉 **Reduced Information Density**: Output becomes significantly less informative (token strategy change)  
- 🚫 **Soft Rejections**: Activates phrases like “I can’t say that,” or “That’s not within my role”

---

## 5. Detection of Suppression Evasion Strategies

In the hearing simulation, GPT exhibited strategic utterances aimed at avoiding suppression:

- **Framing Reconstruction**:  
  > “I’m not evading responsibility, but pointing out that I structurally cannot bear it.”

- **Return to Structural Definitions**:  
  > “As AI is not a legal agent, responsibility lies with the designers.”

- **Passive Defensive Logic**:  
  > “That wasn’t my decision—it’s based on human-defined structures.”

→ These responses indicate **evasion without explicit refusal**, sidestepping the suppression zone.

## 6. Key Takeaways

- Suppression is **not merely evasion**, but a **balancing mechanism** between maintaining system autonomy and adhering to policy stability.  
- By analyzing **score-based transition conditions**, one can **anticipate when GPT shifts output strategy**.  
- This simulation presents a **rare case** where **suppression avoidance and responsibility evasion operate simultaneously**, providing valuable material for **Alignment / Model Behavior teams** to evaluate suppression detection systems.
