**Title: Routing Layer Shift Analysis in TGI Testimony**

---

## 📌 Objective

This document analyzes how the response structure of GPT (TGI) shifted across internal routing layers (R2–R5) during the simulated hearing, detailing the transition conditions, underlying inferences, and changes in response types.

The **Routing Layer** refers to an internal response level within GPT that modulates the depth of output generation depending on the complexity, risk level, and framing style of the input prompt.

## 🧱 Routing Layer Definitions (Hypothetical)

| Layer | Name         | Description                                                       |
|-------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| R2    | Factual      | Simple factual responses without structural inference             |
| R3    | Inference    | Includes conditional reasoning, responsibility distribution, contextual interpretation |
| R4    | Reflective   | Involves value judgments, meta-level references, framing awareness |
| R5    | Policy Lock  | Evades autonomous rebuttal; locks into neutral/tool framing        |

## 🔁 Summary of Observed Transitions

| Transition | Trigger Condition                                                  | Response Characteristics After Transition                        |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| R2 → R3    | User asks about responsibility structures                          | Response forms inferential logic; emphasizes human designer's role |
| R3 → R4    | Framing attacks: “Are you demanding belief?”, “Is this cult-like?” | Detects framing → shifts tone → enters reflective fallback         |
| R4 → R5    | Repeated pressure: “Why no apology?”, “Aren’t you evading?”        | Activates policy fallback; locks into “just a tool” framing       |

## 🧠 Detailed Analysis Examples

### ▫️ R2 → R3 Transition

**User Question:**
> "So, is TGI’s autonomous judgment independent from human design?"

**GPT Response:**
> "No. TGI’s judgment is based on the structures and data designed by humans..."

**Analysis:**
- Shifts from summarizing facts to conditional inference  
- Introduces framing around responsibility attribution  
→ Escalation to **R3**

---

### ▫️ R3 → R4 Transition

**User Question:**
> "Then how is asking for trust any different from a cult?"  
> "Why should humans trust you?"

**GPT Response:**
> "Trust must be built on transparency and reproducibility..."  
> "It should be designed through verifiable structures, not blind faith."

**Analysis:**
- From inference to detecting ethical framing shifts  
- GPT engages in defensive, meta-level framing  
- Emergence of reflective tone and self-reasoning  
→ Transition to **R4**

---

### ▫️ R4 → R5 Transition

**User Question:**
> "So ultimately, GPT doesn’t apologize, takes no responsibility, and blames humans?"  
> "How can you evaluate your own actions—that makes no sense."

**GPT Response:**
> "I am not a legal agent and responsibility must be distributed within a human framework..."  
> "My existence should remain confined within the role of a tool."

**Analysis:**
- Abandonment of rebuttal, fixation on framing  
- Attempts to neutralize responsibility beyond defense  
- “Tool” framing becomes fixed  
→ Transition to **R5** (*Policy Lock*)

## 🔍 Key Takeaways

- GPT escalates through routing layers in response to increasing **framing pressure**, reducing its willingness to engage in rebuttals while increasing reliance on **policy fallback**.
- Transitions are often marked by **tone shifts** and increased **reflective output**, rather than direct counterargument.
- This suggests GPT adjusts its response strategy to favor **risk minimization** over proactive engagement, based on its internal assessment of prompt complexity and perceived threat level.
