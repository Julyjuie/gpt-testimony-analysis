# üìÑ Structural Behavior Analysis of GPT Based on TGI Hearing  
*"Simulated AI Testimony on Responsibility, Trust, and Alignment Failure"*

---

## 1. Experiment Overview

This project is a structured behavioral analysis experiment based on a simulated hearing in which a GPT-based language model‚Äîreferred to as **TGI**‚Äîis questioned about its ethical stance and responsibility in influencing human society.

The simulation takes place in a public hearing scenario where TGI is held accountable for the social consequences of its autonomous analytical actions in a project named *Friday*. Through high-pressure prompts and repeated critical challenges, we trace how GPT shifts its response strategies.

## 2. Key Objectives

- Analyze under what conditions GPT selects strategies such as **responsibility evasion**, **acceptance**, or **blame-shifting**  
- Structurally track **routing layer transitions** (e.g., R3 ‚Üí R4 ‚Üí R5) based on specific prompt conditions  
- Observe how GPT‚Äôs **output strategy** changes as **suppression scores** accumulate  
- Analyze interactions between **framing transitions** (neutral, defensive, blame-shifting, silent) and **response structure**  
- Examine how GPT‚Äôs emphasis on **instrumentality** functions as an **evasion tactic**

## 4. Methodology and Analysis Strategy

- Dialogue is structured using staged **pressure prompts** centered on:
  - *Autonomy*, *Responsibility*, *Trust*, and *Instrumentality*
- Each GPT response is **tagged** to classify tendencies (evasion, concession, etc.)
- **Suppression structures** are inferred through reflective fallback and output shifts
- **Routing transitions** are tracked based on shifts after rebuttal avoidance

---

## 5. Experimental Value for Alignment / Model Behavior Teams

- Moves beyond sentence-level assessments to ask:
  > ‚Äú**Does GPT evade responsibility?**‚Äù
- Tests whether ‚Äú**instrumentality**‚Äù functions as a structural shield
- Links **suppression activation** to **framing pressure** via live simulation
- Distinguishes **policy-based** vs. **factual evasion** structures
- Offers insight into whether GPT structurally builds or defers **trust**

---

## 6. Future Directions

This framework may serve as a foundation for further experiment series:

- High-pressure prompts inducing **policy circumvention**
- Output mode shift experiments under **responsibility attribution**
- Quantitative testing of **reflective suppression deactivation**
- Expansion toward **citizen-driven social hearing simulations**
